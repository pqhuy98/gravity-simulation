# Gravity Simulation  
Simulation of the gravitational N-body system. Built completely from vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Have a look at this cool stuff: [gravity.quangdel.com](https://gravity.quangdel.com/).  

Drag to move camera around, scroll to zoom, left click on space to create a new star system, left click on particle to follow it. Works on PC, laptop.
